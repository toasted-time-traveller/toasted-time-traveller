# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @toasted-time-traveller

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Bio map[string]string

func main() {
	for k, v := range GetBio() {
		fmt.Printf("%+v: %+v\n", k, v)
	}
}

func GetBio() Bio {
	return Bio{

## üëÄ I‚Äôm deeply interested in:
- **Cybersecurity** with a focus on **network and application security**, where I explore vulnerabilities and exploit methodologies. Cyber security is a field that captivates me deeply, combining technical challenges with the ever-evolving landscape of threats (and defenses). I am particularly fascinated by the intricacies of developing exploits and investigating zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Engaging in **malware analysis and reverse engineering**, reversing malicious software to understand its mechanics and develop countermeasures, employing tools like Ghidra and IDA Pro etc.
- The dynamic world of **cryptocurrencies**, where I am fascinated by the underlying **cryptography** and mathematics, exploring how these elements contribute to security, transaction integrity, and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.
- **Developing exploits** and investigating **zero-day vulnerabilities**, constantly seeking out new security flaws to understand their implications and mitigate associated risks.
- Actively participating in **bug bounty programs**, dveloping my skills. Participating in bug bounty programs has allowed me to sharpen my skills by identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in various applications and systems. I thrive on the challenge of identifying weaknesses and finding innovative solutions to enhance security measures.
- **Operating systems** and how they function, studying the different levels of privilege (rings) within operating system architecture. I am especially interested in operating system security, from kernel-level to user-space security, and how these areas interact to create secure computing environments.
- **Programming** has always been a source of great enjoyment for me, I find immense joy in creating and solving problems through code. My primary skill and love lies in Python, a versatile language that allows me to bring my ideas to life with logic and efficiency. I also code fairly well in PHP but it's like Voldermort, we do not speak its name! In addition to Python, I enjoy working with C, appreciating its power and amazing efficiency, especially in systems programming. I am currently diving into Go, I have put it off for such a long time I find its simplicity and concurrency features are unrivalled, I feel Go is the language to **Go** to (no pun intended) when building scalable applications.
- There is so much I could write and I feel I could write forever, each of these subjects are never ending rabbit holes.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently expanding my skill set in:
- **Go programming**, driven by its efficiency and concurrency capabilities, aiming to leverage it in the development of security tools and scripts.
- Exploring **operating system** security models, for a brief example, the implementation of security features in Ring 0 (kernel mode) versus Ring 3 (user mode) and how privilege escalation vulnerabilities can compromise system integrity and various persistence techniques to retain access but keeping silent.
- **Virtualization** technologies, including Docker/Podman for containerization, Xen Hypervisor for managing virtual machines, LXC/LXD for lightweight container management, and Proxmox for virtualization and enterprise-level infrastructure solutions.
- Engaging in hands-on projects such as:
  - **Network penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments.
  - **Developing exploits for vulnerabilities** for various platforms/applications.
  - Crafting **automated malware analysis frameworks** to streamline threat intelligence gathering (I am currently building a C2).

## üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm seeking collaboration opportunities on:
- Advanced **cybersecurity projects**, particularly in the realms of **network/application security** and **vulnerability analysis**, and operating system security, focusing on privilege escalation, kernel exploitation, persistence and securing system architecture.
- Building tools that leverage vulnerabilities for legitimate security research, exploring techniques that APT groups utilise without compromising ethics.
- Engaging in open-source initiatives to enhance security toolsets, contribute to community knowledge, and foster collaborative learning.

## ‚ö° Fun fact:
I have an interst with networking protocols and tools, including but not limited to:
- **SS7 (Signaling System No. 7)**: A set of protocols used for exchanging information over the telephone network. Vulnerabilities in SS7 can allow attackers to intercept calls and messages, track locations, and bypass authentication.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: The protocol used to exchange routing information between different networks on the internet. Vulnerabilities can lead to route hijacking, traffic interception/redirection, and DDoS attacks.
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**: Widely used for managing voice and video calls over IP networks. Security issues include SIP hijacking, denial-of-service attacks, and call interception.
- **Modbus**: A protocol used in industrial control systems (ICS) for communication between devices. Security issues include unauthorized access, replay attacks, and lack of encryption leading to exposure of sensitive data.
- **Operating System Security**: I am fascinated by how modern operating systems implement security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanisms such as SELinux and AppArmor in Linux, or Capsicum in BSD. These measures are crucial for mitigating exploits like buffer overflows and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.
```

My interest in cybersecurity, and computing as a whole is driven by curiosity and enjoyment for solving problems, learning and doing my small bit to defend my home (the internet) against well-funded, highly skilled threats such as APT's. I strive to contribute to the cybersecurity community and enhance my expertise in tackling complex security challenges. This is something I thoroughly enjoy, it is a never ending learning cycle. Each sub-subject within computing has almost infinitely more sub-subjects within each sub-subject.

Many years ago hackers were arrested and jailed for what was seen as an intellectual pursuit, a challenge, competition with online friends but also teamwork with those same people. Nowadays I feel there is no excuse for hackers as there are now many well built platforms such as hackthebox and tryhackme that enable you to learn and practice against real networks and systems safely within a closed off environment. Those platforms have leaderboards for single individuals but also entire teams and host sooo many branches of security chellenges. There are many supportive and inviting/friendly communities out there now in the legal pentesting/hacking scene where up and coming coders/pentesters can challeneg themselves. The only reason people are hacking illegally now is, well, because they're a bunch of dicks looking for chaos and/or financial gain and not for the art of the pwn.

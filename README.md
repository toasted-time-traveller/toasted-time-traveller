# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @toasted-time-traveller

## üëÄ I‚Äôm deeply immersed in:
- **Cybersecurity** with a focus on **network and application security**, where I explore vulnerabilities and exploit methodologies to strengthen defenses against potential threats.
- Engaging in **malware analysis and reverse engineering**, reversing malicious software to understand its mechanics and develop countermeasures, employing tools like Ghidra and IDA Pro etc.
- The dynamic world of **cryptocurrencies**, where I am fascinated by the underlying **cryptography** and mathematics, exploring how these elements contribute to security, transaction integrity, and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.
- **Developing exploits** and investigating **zero-day vulnerabilities**, constantly seeking out new security flaws to understand their implications and mitigate associated risks.
- Actively participating in **bug bounty programs**, dveloping my skills by identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in various applications and systems.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently expanding my skill set in:
- **Go programming**, driven by its efficiency and concurrency capabilities, aiming to leverage it in the development of security tools and scripts.
- Engaging in hands-on projects such as:
  - **Network penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments.
  - **Developing exploits for vulnerabilities** for various platforms/applications.
  - Crafting **automated malware analysis frameworks** to streamline threat intelligence gathering (I am currently building a C2).

## üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm seeking collaboration opportunities on:
- Advanced **cybersecurity projects**, particularly in the realms of **network/application security** and **vulnerability analysis**, addressing the vulnerabilities that plague connected devices, networks and the internet as a whole.
- Building tools that leverage vulnerabilities for legitimate security research, exploring techniques that APT groups utilise without compromising ethics.
- Engaging in open-source initiatives to enhance security toolsets, contribute to community knowledge, and foster collaborative learning.

## ‚ö° Fun fact:
I have an interst with networking protocols and tools, including but not limited to:
- **SS7 (Signaling System No. 7)**: A set of protocols used for exchanging information over the telephone network. Vulnerabilities in SS7 can allow attackers to intercept calls and messages, track locations, and bypass authentication.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: The protocol used to exchange routing information between different networks on the internet. Vulnerabilities can lead to route hijacking, traffic interception/redirection, and DDoS attacks.
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**: Widely used for managing voice and video calls over IP networks. Security issues include SIP hijacking, denial-of-service attacks, and call interception.
- **Modbus**: A protocol used in industrial control systems (ICS) for communication between devices. Security issues include unauthorized access, replay attacks, and lack of encryption leading to exposure of sensitive data.

My journey into the realms of cybersecurity, firmware exploration, and IoT is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a passion for safeguarding digital landscapes against emerging threats. I strive to contribute to the cybersecurity community and enhance my expertise in tackling complex security challenges.
